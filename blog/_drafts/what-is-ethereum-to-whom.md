Technically, Ethereum is a decentralized consensus system where programs(called contracts)
run with agreement about their state and what they do. The ethers as 
cryptocurrency are a necessary side effect. Conversely, distributed consensus
plus turing completeness implies cryptocurrencies can be build ontop.

However points of view differ more on what it is *to people*. **It is...**

## .. a system to make contracts more clear

Unsurprisingly, it is often lawyers with these foremost in their mind. 
They deal most with regular contracts. From what i have heard
(from Casey Kuhlman) is that in contract disputes it is usually about either:

* what the terms mean
* what happened

The code always runs the same, and the consensus mechanism forces agreement on
the input of the contract. I.e. about what happened.

For instance [the Etherscripter](http://etherscripter.com/what_is_ethereum.html)
and [Casey Kuhlmann](https://tao.epm.io/entries/2014/notes-from-my-ethereum-talk.html)
view it this way.(my understanding of it and I paraphrase!)

## .. for DAOs

**D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **O**rganizations, or
**D**ecentralized **O**rganizations, the latter term formed because the autonomy
of the contract may be disputable. There is probably a spectrum between those.
When the group behind the organization is tightly nit, and they have a lot of
leeway with the contract, it is more like a DO. When it is more loosely knit,
or not knit at all, it is a DAO.

I do like the idea of open DAOs that accept work from anyone,
[as i espoused in an earlier post](http://o-jasper.github.io/blog/2014/05/08/show-up-jobs.html).

Both DOs and DAOs *may* have self-modification mechanisms.
([DOUG](https://github.com/dennismckinnon/Ethereum-Contracts/tree/master/DOUG)
being one in development) If they do, the mechanisms
for disallowing/allowing changes to the DAO has to be effective. For instance
a DAO may have stakeholders vote on letter a change through.
(use of the votes doesnt have to be a simple tally)

Stakeholders could be anything; employees, customers, stock holders, or even
other DAOs.(and combinations) People behind these will usually have to
thoroughly inspect the change.

The importance of the checks on those modifications are particularly important
if the DAO is 'infrastructure like'. 

Another point about DAOs/DOs they need a 'business model' or social
reason for existance. The latter is a business model from the DAO contract
perspective too!

I would be amiss not to mention
[Vitalics series of DACs](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/7050/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i/).

## .. a tool for derivatives and hedging

These seem somewhat few to be found in ethereum, presumably because they are
often attracted to alternatives like Mastercoin, CounterParty, colored coins, 
or Ripple who serve their needs, at least to a large extent. Nevertheless with
those options i cannot help but think, where is the arbitrary logic?

## .. the consensus part of web 3.0 

Perhaps the most general one of the bunch. The idea here is that it will come
with a browser, and decentralized collection of files people can add to. These
files could be complete webpages, like those representing the above ideas.

One of the founders of Ethereum, Gavin Wood,
[most strongly comes from this direction](http://insightsintoamodernworld.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/less-techy-what-is-web-30.html). ([presentation about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJGIeSCgsk)) I suspect he is the origin of the idea.(but i can't tell)

## It is a consensus engine
The "it can run arbitrary programs, it could do anything" comes over as a
cop-out, so people dont say that. Instead they say what is more on their minds
or their hearts.

It is a good thing, because only by going down one of the roads can the
bandwidth of a conversation reach any detail.

That doesnt mean they dont know about different directions of course, i don't
mean to imply i am being original, the idea was to recap the different 
directions that i see. In a way i dont expect this blog post to be exhaustive
about the directions either.
