<p>Consider an action where failure implies you get <span class="math">F</span>(<span class="math">&lt;0</span>) and success <span class="math">S</span>(<span class="math">&gt;0</span>),
you think the probability of success is <span class="math">p</span>.. You think the average is:</p>

<blockquote class="math">
<table><tr><td></td><td>Failure</td> <td>Success</td> <td>Average</td> </tr>
<tr> <td style="visibility:hidden">Gambler</td> <td>F</td> <td>S</td> <td>(1-p)F + pS</td><td>= p(S-F) + F</td></table>
</blockquote>


<p>Now there is someone willing to bet, he believes that the probability is
infact <span class="math">q</span>. He offers compensation if it fails <span class="math">C</span>, but he wants <span class="math">&beta;C</span>
if it succeeds.</p>

<blockquote class="math">
<table><tr> <td></td> <td>Failure</td> <td>Success</td> <td>Average</td> </tr>
<tr><td>You</td> <td>F+C</td> <td>S-&beta;C</td>
<td>(1-p)(F+C) + p(S-&beta;C)</td><td> =  p(S-F-C(1+&beta;)) + F + C</td> </tr>
<tr><td>Gambler</td> <td>-C</td> <td>&beta;C</td> 
<td>-(1-q)C + q&beta;C</td><td>= qC(1+&beta;) - C</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>


<p>Now You will accept if you will do better than earlier;</p>

<blockquote class="math">
   p(S-F-C(1+&beta;)) + F + C &ge; p(S-F) + F <br><br>
     
   -pC(1+&beta;) + C &ge; 0 <br><br>
     
   &beta; &le; 1/p -1
</blockquote>


<p>So the payout of success and failure; <span class="math">S</span>, <span class="math">F</span> dont matter! In general can add
whatever you want and it doesnt matter. It is just a bet? So why do just bet for
stuff like insurance?</p>

<p>Three reasons come to mind:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Our utility(wellbeing) is not linear with the amount of money we own.
<span class="math">U(F)</span> and <span class="math">U(S)</span> are much further apart than <span class="math">F</span> and <span class="math">S</span>.
But <span class="math">U(F+C)</span> and <span class="math">U(S-&beta;C)</span>.. Infact we can approximate;
<blockquote class="math">
   U(F+C) - U(S-&beta;C) &asymp; U'(F+C)&sdot;(F + C - S + &beta;C)
</blockquote><br/>
This aswel makes this calculation still work as the approximation is linear
and the factor doesnt matter for the analysis. So the bet is in a sense a
side issue.</p></li>
<li><p>The mechanisms in which someone else bets that way indicates someone else has
trust in -for instance- a vendor.</p></li>
<li><p>You are particularly aware of the risks and deals and their probability.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Of course, in the current world, insurers are often large institutions and their
many bets even out.</p>

<p>It can also be investment, where <span class="math">C</span> is given beforehand.
This implies that it can be used as stake. After all, if a contract(like RANDAO)
requires ethers as stake, and a gambler trusts you would not lose that stake,
he can make a deal. If you fail, his belief in you will decrease; that would be
the what is at stake for you.</p>

<h2>The gambler side</h2>

<p>The gambler, assume he wants some profit; <span class="math">E</span></p>

<blockquote class="math">
   qC(1+&beta;) - C &ge; E <br><br>

   &beta; &ge; (E/C +1)/q -1 = 1/q' - 1
</blockquote>


<p>But then we notice that the profit motive shows itself as an apparent probability;
<span class="math">q' = q/(E/C + 1)</span> as the gambler can change the two accordingly, there is
not point to the freedom; we choose <span class="math">E=0</span> and note that probability is only
apparent.</p>

<p>A deal is possible if: <span class="math">1/p -1 &ge; &beta; &ge; 1/q' -1</span></p>

<h2>Many gamblers</h2>

<p>From many gamblers, the best deal is from one with the highest
(Apparent)probability, he will be able to demand the smallest payment. Perhaps,
however, he doesnt have enough money, or doesnt want to risk at those probabilities
that much money. Here this would be again because of nonlinearity of utility, but
also because the probability of failure may be dependent on the amount.</p>

<p>If we assume we have the comprehensive list of gamblers, after a gambler is
depleted, you can go to the next one with a lower <span class="math">q</span>.</p>

<p>We presumably can find these gamblers within a system in Ethereum. Mind that
finding them being possibly client-side massively increases the ability to
search without using gas. You search client-side, and then just tell the
contracts where to go to convince it.</p>

<p>Note that the estimation of probability may not also feel that way to the user.
For instance, if the bet is about the ability of a web shop to deliver, the user
might see prices based on what the bets are wrt insuring the transaction. The
user simply bets by accepting the price.</p>

<h2>Stabilizing gambler income</h2>

<p>The gambler expects on average factor on the input ethers per unit time. However
depending on the number of bets and their dependence, actual results can vary.
He could insure himself against it, or predict some growth use a Contract for
a difference where people may bet it is more.</p>

<p>Of course, the insurance and contract for a difference may largely be the same
thing.</p>

<h2>In relation to reputation networks</h2>

<p>Actions can be deals between people, or even a single person. The estimated
probability can depend on what those people are like.</p>

<p>So there is a relation to reputation, this can two ways;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The reputation network is used to estimate the probabilities. And people
handling it take their consequences based on failing deals.</p></li>
<li><p>Working backward from the probabilities to reputation. Oppositely,
the insurance builds the reputation system. This one is likely much harder.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Of course, there is much more to be said about this topic.</p>
