Recently i have been thinking about escrow a bit, in particular the kind where
a merchant sells a good to a customer, and one wants the money, and the other
wants a good product.

Embarrassingly, i have sort-of not found some of the things i thought i might
regarding ['insuring these'](http://o-jasper.github.io/blog/2014/05/09/InsuranceGamble.html).

There are two escrow mechanisms of the kind, one where the payment is locked up
and a arbitrator decides if the payment goes to the merchant. And another where
payment, plus stake is locked up, and the customer can unlock it for and receive
his stake.




An arbitrator doesnt have a particularly easy job. The shipping part can
indicate whether or not it arrived, but not much else. In case of damage during
shipping, the shipper has a perverse incentive.
