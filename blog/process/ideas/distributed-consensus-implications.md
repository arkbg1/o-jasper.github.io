# Distributed consensus implications.

You could say, 'but it has a coin, so it is a cryptocurrency'. However, it is
simply neccessary; the computing power and storage of the network is scarce, and
something is needed to regulated it. (every node has to execute everything,
its [No 1. on the improvements list](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Problems#user-content-big-problems-in-cryptocurrency)) 
Also, *something* needs to incentivize mining that secures the network.
(this includes the proof of stake mining, it too needs to be incentivized)

Conversely, once you have distributed consensus, you can necessarily
do currencies, because everyone can agree to add some number to the
'value of Alice' and substract it from the 'value of Bob'. Where value is
often termed 'balance'. There inevitably would be a currency on the system.

I suppose this begs an open question, does outlawing creation of currencies
imply you outlaw distributed consensus?
