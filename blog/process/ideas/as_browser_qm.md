# Ethereum as a browser

There are problems with trying to spread Ethereum as a browser; it is fairly
hard to convert people. Initially this is less of a problem, because the
first users are the one that do change their tools. More 'convenience' oriented
wont change tool, even if they have a clearly inferior tool.
(Internet explorer for instance, although they eventually did finally do some
improvements... My disliking of closed source aside)

Alternatives to getting people to use the Ethereum browser:

* Getting existing browsers to add Ethereum. However, if people are convenience
  users and nodes are not loyal, one of the parties might try do a hostile hard
  fork. 

* Doing browser addons. Because users add them themselves, they're less likely
  to be passive about it.

* Going via servers.. However it is important that users use identification
  mechanisms that they can do directly to the blockchain itself later.
