Likely it needs some kind of reputation system. For instance a 'wikipedia DAO'
can leverage the fact that reviewers of a change are reviewing both that it is
correct to add to a page and who made it, whereas 'generalistic' publishing DAOs
there is no obvious way to send people to review if things are derivative.

#### DHT perhaps not entirely neccesary

Note that methods enforcing the use of advertising may not be entirely
necessary. Advertisers could simply try 'patrol' the pages and place the value
besed on whether pages indeed show the ads. 

In the context of package repositories, an idea i heard from Casey Kuhlmann was
that you can use the combination of  name registries that help hold on to a name,
loyalty between open source developpers to credit their dependencies to create a
payment system.

Question how far they are dependent on the loyalty of users, where people copy
an entire tree. There will always people that are loyal to those developers, but
more people that are contributing economically by paying to the real authorship,
the better.

Of course, DHT approach also has this issue somewhat, as browsers can ignore the
ads.
