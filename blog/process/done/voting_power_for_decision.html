<h1>Voting power needed for decisions</h1>

<p>In the latest DAO design jam, we discussed voting systems,
<strong>TODO</strong> I am sure Casey will write a recap?(or someone anyway) In this
post, quite a lot is assumed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Who votes and their voting power will be assumed to be pre-set.</p></li>
<li><p>The decision does not change voting powers.</p></li>
<li><p>There is only one such group. (In principle, a DAO might give different voting
 power to different people, depending who is involved)</p></li>
<li><p>The values can somehow be measured.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This helps me introduce the first in list of reasons why bigger decisions
require more voting power:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <strong>sub-linearity of utility</strong> relative to units of money. If utility is some
function <span class="math">U(A)</span> where <span class="math">A</span> is an amount. If you&rsquo;re in a desert zero versus one
bottle for water makes a big difference. 1000 versus 1001, not so much.</p>

<p>With <span class="math">p</span> the chance of a decision coming out mad, with monetary result <span class="math">B</span>,
good <span class="math">G</span> and initial <span class="math">I</span> you need <span class="math">p &lt; (U(G) - U(I)) / (U(G) - U(B))</span>. <span class="math">U</span> is
the sublinear function; <span class="math">U''(x)&lt;0</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher levels of stake increases the chance that stolen private keys, or
&lsquo;treason&rsquo; are the cause of the decisions, or at least, or are at that point
attempting to affect the DO/DAO.</p></li>
<li><p>Fairness of ability to use risk-taking ability. People that are first to take
some risk with the DO/DAO arent necessarily the best ones.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of multiple smaller decisions, the failure/success of them cannot
assumed to be independent. If decided by one person, it should be considered
a single probability of failure on the whole.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>An approach</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Take account of the superlinearity, means we need to figure a <span class="math">U</span> that
represents it well. This is hard, but then, the value of the things decided
about itself is hard to estimate.</p>

<p><span class="math">U</span> can be dependent on the current state. For instance for a &lsquo;conservative&rsquo;
<span class="math">U</span>, any possibly lowering value is taken as very negative, making it very
risk averse.</p></li>
<li><p>Take dependence on size of the decision into account with the probability.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep in reserve ability to risk, calculating the <span class="math">p</span> other groups can reach,
and then ensuring they can actually risk some amount of value.</p>

<p>Increasing the number of voters does not help here, as long as enough
abstain/vote against, which has to be reserved for. Nevertheless, possibly
a decision is desirable nevertheless.</p>

<p>There is the possibility of instead of keeping the reserve, you stretch the
duration of the vote, and allow multiple ideas to compete, and after a longer
time than usual, the vote goes through, not respecting reserve.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually do account for them that way.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Obviously this is easier said than done!</p>

<h4>The reserve bit</h4>

<p>Each vote gets <span class="math">r</span> reserve-to-vote, then it should be able to get a vote through
assuming <span class="math">&beta;</span> potential gain. Including if <span class="math">n</span> pool their voting power;</p>

<blockquote class="math"><span class="math"> &forall; n &le; remaining voters: p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; (U(I + &beta;rn) - U(I))/(U(I + &beta;rn) - U(I-rn))

<p>Note that you could see <span class="math">n</span> as continuous, i.e. people with more voting power
add more than <span class="math">1</span> to the vote, and have more than <span class="math">r</span> reserve ability.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the highest <span class="math">n</span> possible is the one that counts, as the
probability goes up alswel.</p>
