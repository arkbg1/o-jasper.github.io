Just my opinion of course. Note that consensus is largely unknowingly, by
extension of trust.

    Protocol        E,A      4    Hopefully not much? Still, could be monitoring for

    Communication                 dealing with misconceptions, etcetera.
                                 

    Presentation    E        2    More or less how things look.

### Emergencies
There is also the idea of emergencies. You could have a temporary vote that
automatically gives some positions the ability to use *those* votes cart-blanche
in a particular direction, for a limited amount of time and number of uses.
These would be short-term events.

* (most dramatic) would be like a Ethereum 1.0 critical protocol issue.
* Critical contract issues.
* Critical DAO code issue.
* Hacking of member computers/loss of pubkeys.

When it is a contract, the emergency should be aimable at the particular thing
that the emergency is about.

Emergencies should have some post-event assessment.

### Decision making
Stakeholders/affected people should be able to weigh in. They are indicated
by who are affects. Of course we can only weigh them in insofar we can reliably
identify them, and perhaps insofar they do not sell their vote.

People are against and for. When to decide?

* If risk is high, many must vote for. (critical contracts, DAO modification)

* If costs are low, and potential gains are high, few must vote for, even
  against counter voters.

* If it is a process, that must happen continually, it is a position? If risks
  are high, a few votes must be able to bring up discussion?

### Trust or enforce?

Of course, sometimes you may want to trust someone? I do not think that is true
for any of the critical parts, but it is try for communication and presentation,
mainly, and it affects the leeway in positions.
