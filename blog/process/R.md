Reputation systems.

## Mine
i have been thinking of it as essentially a thing where everyone has his opinion
everyone can bootstrap, and interesting model is where you get to give away α of 
what you have, then by giving it to yourself you can at max get 1/(1-α)
and when reputations need to be calculated you provide the paths you want that show a 
line of reputation from the other party to yourself
the incentive to give others reputation would presumbably a little reward for when 
people use you as a path but there also still needs to be a way to lose reputation, 
i reckon

and @ everyone who didn't read what i was writing in the long discussion
:P The method I proposed (probably has been invented before but its new to me) was
exactly the parents get the sins of the child. but you apply a function to determine
just how much "backlash" you get. If you supplied 100% of the child's rep then you
get exactly the same punishment as the child. if you supplied 90% you get greater
then 90% of the punishment in return. (i wish i could draw the weighting function
i'm envisioning. If you provided less then some % of the childs rep then you actually
get deminished backlash. This focuses the attack on groups which obtain most of thier
rep from a few sources while disapating backlash in naturally-grown community rep
(lots of people giving small amounts)
the problem is that in order to do this. you need to store the vouching status of
everyone for everyone on the complete graph (in worse case)

and updating things would be massively expensive
