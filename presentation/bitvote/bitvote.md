# SOPA

SOPA blackout; not just Google and Wikipedia,

People had to promote it a lot to get there

# Loudness of signal

essentially a vote by loudness. Largely it was spamming ('twitter storm')
  
inefficient and not necessary proportional, i.e. ""

This loudness can be represented by a simple number, how much do you care about
this thing?

# Solution

What does the solution look like, functionally? 

* Every**one** get **one** vote hour per hour &rarr;
  + needs keep track of how much vote&sdot;time users have and subjects got.
  + needs one person per account.

* If you want to be loud, just spend a lot of votehours on something.

* Topics can be on any link.

# What it looks like

... show interface(demo) ...

# Button

... show .. idea for button that goes onto a page ...

# Need for **de**centralization

Otherwise:

* Single place to sue/threaten.

* Requires trust towards the operators.

* Just not cool.

# Ethereum

This can be done with an Ethereum contract.

Ethereum comes with a browser. It has Javascript that can get data from the
Ethereum contract and send transactions for voting.

interfaces from arbitrary pages are possible

# Open problems

* Large numbers of users;
  
  Whereas Ethereum can be useful in an ecosystem, Bitvote needs to scale.
  
  Currently no real solution(perhaps hanging blocks) just things that help.
  
* One per ID:
  
  + Computer-hard things
  
  + Synchronized computer-hard actions that the contract is somehow aware of.

    Peak demand makes it harder to fool.
    
  + Reputation system where people indicate each other and 'detectives' with
    enough reputation can challenge people having multiple IDs.
    
  Note that this is something other things might also want; 'UBI coin'
  ('socialcoin')
